No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

The calibration is based on observing a planar checkerboard pattern and solving for constraints between the "views" of a planar checkerboard calibration pattern from a camera and laser range finder. We give a direct solution that minimizes an algebraic error from this constraint, and subsequent nonlinear refinement minimizes a re-projection error. To our knowledge, this is the first published calibration tool for this problem. Additionally we show how this constraint can reduce the variance in estimating intrinsic camera parameters.},

	abstract = {Human actions can be considered as a sequence of body poses over time, usually represented by coordinates corresponding to human skeleton models. Recently, a variety of low-cost devices have been released, able to produce markerless real time pose estimation. Nevertheless, limitations of the incorporated {RGB}-D sensors can produce inaccuracies, necessitating the utilization of alternative representation and classification schemes in order to boost performance. In this context, we propose a method for action recognition where skeletal data are initially processed in order to obtain robust and invariant pose representations and then vectors of dissimilarities to a set of prototype actions are computed. The task of recognition is performed in the dissimilarity space using sparse representation. A new publicly available dataset is introduced in this paper, created for evaluation purposes. The proposed method was also evaluated on other public datasets, and the results are compared to those of similar methods.},

The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics.The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the {PAC}-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a {MATLAB} software package--{PMTK} (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

Practical nonlinear probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video sequences.},

	abstract = {We describe a "bag-of-rectangles" method for representing and recognizing human actions in videos. In this method, each human pose in an action sequence is represented by oriented rectangular patches extracted over the whole body. Then, spatial oriented histograms are formed to represent the distribution of these rectangular patches. In order to carry the information from the spatial domain described by the bag-of-rectangles descriptor to temporal domain for recognition of the actions, four different methods are proposed. These are namely, (i) frame by frame voting, which recognizes the actions by matching the descriptors of each frame, (ii) global histogramming, which extends the idea of Motion Energy Image proposed by Bobick and Davis by rectangular patches, (iii) a classifier based approach using {SVMs}, and (iv) adaptation of Dynamic Time Warping on the temporal representation of the descriptor. The detailed experiments are carried out on the action dataset of Blank et. al. High success rates (100\%) prove that with a very simple and compact representation, we can achieve robust recognition of human actions, compared to complex representations.},

	abstract = {A novel nonlinear probabilistic feature extraction method, called Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, is introduced to discover generalised and continuous low dimensional representation of multivariate time series data in the presence of stylistic variations. This is achieved by incorporating a new spatio-temporal constraining prior over latent spaces within the likelihood optimisation of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models ({GPLVM}). As a result, the core pattern of multivariate time series is extracted, whereas a style variability is marginalised. We validate the method by qualitative comparison of different {GPLVM} variants with their proposed spatio-temporal versions. In addition we provide quantitative results on a classification application, i.e. view-invariant action recognition, where imposing spatio-temporal constraints is essential. Performance analysis reveals that our spatio-temporal framework outperforms the state of the art.},
